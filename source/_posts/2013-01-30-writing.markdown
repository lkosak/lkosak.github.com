For the last few months I've been going through a period of transition that I've started calling the **lourenaissance**. To fuel this fire, one of my big priorities has been doing things to balance out the 12+ hours a day I spend in front of screens. These things include:

* Hand writing letters to nice people.
* Walking all over the place.
* Cooking more and eating more meals at home.
* Listening to the entire\* Harry Potter series on audiobook while doing most of the above.

Granted, that last one's probably not the healthiest habit.

Anyway, I'm also trying to get in the habit of writing more. Here's a first effort, prompted by a challenge from my friend [Mischa](http://twitter.com/mischa):

**[About a bike](/writing/about-a-bike.html)**

Hope you like it.

\* Not Philosopher's Stone or Chamber. Those books are for *children*.
