  <p>My dad, Jeffrey Allan Kosak, purchased a bike in 1984 (&#8220;just a few months before you were born&#8221;) from a friend who owned a fancy bicycle shop in Hanover, New Hampshire. It was one of the nicer racing bikes available at the time, with modern hardware and a lightweight steel frame, made by the Japanese manufacturer Miyata. The seatpost was fluted&#8211;a popular, ineffectual strategy in the eighties for reducing weight&#8211;and the cable housings were made with translucent plastic that exposed the helical steel wire running underneath. These small details had the effect of making the bike look fucking awesome. It was also painted a fast-looking shade of red.</p>

<p>My dad trained on that bike throughout the &#8217;80s and early &#8217;90s. When he moved our family to The Hotchkiss School in the fall of 1984, he quickly struck up a friendship with the manager of the school&#8217;s dining services, a reformed fatty who had transformed himself into one of the top Triple Ironman competitors in the world. The two of them would go out for long rides in the rolling farmland around the school, exploring back roads and racing with each other. By all accounts, my dad&#8211;a conspicuously fit lifelong hockey player&#8211;held his own.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure when my dad stopped riding that bike. By the mid nineties it was mostly parked in his basement, and he alternated among a fleet of three-speed cruisers purchased at local tag sales to make his daily quarter mile commute to campus. Every year, in the spring, he&#8217;d talk about wanting to get out on it again, but knee pain from an old ACL surgery held him off. The summer after my junior year of highschool, I got interested in cycling and asked him if I could borrow it.</p>

<p>I was intimidated by it at first&#8211;I&#8217;d grown up around that bike, and it occupied a high place in the pantheon of my father&#8217;s worldly goods (alongside such lifelong icons as &#8220;the ten pound splitting maul&#8221;, &#8220;the infrequently smoked tobacco pipe&#8221;, and &#8220;the collection of fountain pens that I am not allowed to use&#8221;). The first time I took it out for a ride, wearing the overly-tight cycling shoes my dad had provided, I felt like an imposter. As I pedaled along the country roads of my hometown, however, I fell in love. It was like driving a TIE fighter.</p>

<p>When I went away to college, I left the bike at my mom&#8217;s house. I&#8217;d ride it occasionally when I was home in the summer, but for years it remained there, unused, waiting to be returned to my dad whenever he got around to asking for it.</p>

<p>Then, the summer before my senior year, he moved away. As he was packing his house in preparation for a partial-retirement to France, I asked him if he wanted his bike back. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s pretty much your bike, now,&#8221; he replied. That September, with some uneasiness, I loaded the bike into my mom&#8217;s minivan and took it with me to Montreal.</p>

<p>The bike survived my final year at McGill (no mean feat in the bike theft capital of North America), and another two in New York. It was the largest possession to make the move west with me to San Francisco. In the two years that I&#8217;ve lived here, I&#8217;ve had two wheels stolen, three saddles, and three seatposts (including that lovely fluted one). Every time something&#8217;s taken, I spend a few days weighing the cost of a replacement against the price of a fancy new bike, searching for a way to justify the upgrade. Then I look at my 28 year old bike, and shrug, and walk down to the bicycle shop to pick up the part.</p>
